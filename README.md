# TinDog

This is a Udemy Project I completed through the use of HTML and CSS.
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the CSS framework called Bootstrap to incorporate into my web development projects.
Through this project, I was able to learn about content delivery networks, or CDNs, and how to use them.
